            <section><h3>Intro</h3>
                <p>My name is <em>Matthew Cain</em>, and I am an aspiring <em>software developer</em> cultivating my craft under the tutelage of <em>Thinkful</em>.</p>
                <p>Hailing from a little north of Boston, Massachusetts, I firmly believe that our lack of natural progression through the 4 seasons has prepared me for a life of unpredictability, and adjusting to change. For this reason, among others, I feel confident in attacking any and all problems this course has to offer!</p>

            <section><h3>Coding Experience</h3>
                <p>I started teaching myself programming earlier this year, and fell in love very quickly! I figured since we were not supposed to leave the house, I might as well be productive!  I took a few Python classes online, as well as read a few books with fun projects. As soon as I finished one program I was itching for whatever the next one had in store for me!</p>
                <p>I eventually found myself attempting a full stack course with no instructor, or peers. Having worked in the restaraunt industry just shy of 10 years, I missed the comradery and support that comes with group work. </p>
