                My name is Matthew Cain, and I am a 30 year old studying software development with Thinkful. I live about 40 minutes north of Boston.

                <p>I was first introduced to computer programming back in high school, where I learned very basic HTML and Python. Earlier this spring, when we were following the stay-at-home guidelines, I found myself reading up on these coding languages again, just for fun. As it turns out, I have not been able to turn my curiosity off, and am thrilled to pursue an education in the software development feild.</p>
                <p>Having worked in the restaraunt industry for the past 10 years, the concept of teamwork is very important to me. I liken it to a quote by the late Anthony Bourdaine: 
                </p>
                <p><em>"There's an empathy that can only be cultivated by those who've stood between a hungry mouth and a $28 pork chop, a special understanding of the way a bunch of motley misfits can be a family."</em></p>

                I typically find I enjoy activities that require some level of creativity. Some of my other hobbies include, cooking, playing music, and photography (see background image).
