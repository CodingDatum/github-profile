            <h2>Here's a little about me:</h2>
            <section id="aboutme"><h3>Intro</h3>
                <p>My name is <em>Matthew Cain</em>, and I am an aspiring <em>software developer</em> hailing from a little north of Boston Massachusetts.</p>
                <p>Prior to my studies in programming, I was a full time restaraunt employee. While I held the positions of "Server", "Bartender", and "Manager on Duty" by title,
                I soon came to realize that I had to become much more flexible than simply the duties that each position entailed.</p><p> Being apart of the food-service industry,
                I learned about hard work, the importance of communication, how to effectively work as a team, and how to efficiently and expeditiously addres issues as they arose, quite frequently I might add.</p>          
                </section>
            <hr>


            <section id="experience"><h3>Coding Experience</h3>
                <p>Currently I am cultivating my craft under the tutelage of <em>"The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp"</em> with <em>The London App Brewery's</em> very own <em>Angela Yu</em>.</p>
                <p>Because many of the previous classes I attempted were based off of expired material, I learned how to become independant, and privy to navigating the web for the correct solutions. </p>

            </section>
            <hr>


            <section id="hobbies"><h3>Other Hobbies/Skills</h3>
                <p>I've always been drawn to creative endeavores. Therefore, usually my spare time is filled with:</p>
                
                <!-- I cannot figure out why my ordered lists have no style even though I identified a style here as well as in style.css -->
                
                <ol style="list-style:upper-roman">
                    <li><strong>Playing piano and singing</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Cooking</strong>-<sub>(with lots of garlic!)</sub></li>
                    <li><strong>Photography</strong><sub>(pictures coming soon)</sub></li>
                </ol>
                <p>Much like my programming, I also developed these skills through hundreds of hours of self-taught learning, and many many phases of trial and error.</p>
